    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Cycling is my hobby whenever i have free time. Not just because it good for our health, it we also can enjoy the scenery and feel the natural winds. It is a good exercise to improve family relationship or friends relationship. Most of the time i am cycling with my bestfriend, while we cycling we were chatting about anything.To me, cycling means getting outside and having fun, being free, getting away from everything into my own little world. It means keeping a positive fighting attitude in all aspects of life.</p>
